<h1><u>Form 3 Roses Graded Marks</u></h1>
<p>On the 25<sup>th</sup> of January 2021, form 3 students were given CATS to test
their knowledge in accordance to where they are in the syllabus.</p>
<div>
    They were given CATS for subjects such as Mathematics, English and Computer Studies.
    We'll display 3/10 student graded marks. Most of the students have performed above
    average which therefore is a good sign because the INTER-COUNTY MOCK exams are
    around the corner. They're being displayed below as:
